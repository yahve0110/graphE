## Project Description

This project is created to learn the GraphQL query language by creating a custom profile page. The project uses the GraphQL endpoint provided by the platform (https://01.kood.tech/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql) to query data and populate the user profile page.

## Key Features

### Profile Page

The profile page displays the following information:
- Basic user information
- XP amount
- Grades
- Audits
- Skills

### Statistical Graphs

The profile page also includes a statistics section where you can generate graphs to visualize your progress and achievements at the school. The graphs are created using SVG and include:
- Graph of earned XP over a certain period
- Graph of earned XP by projects
- PASS and FAIL project ratio
- And other graphs of your choice

### Login Page

To access the data, a JWT is required, which can be obtained from the signin endpoint (https://01.kood.tech/api/auth/signin). The login page supports login with:
- Username and password
- Email and password

If the credentials are invalid, an appropriate error message is displayed. A method for logging out is also provided.
